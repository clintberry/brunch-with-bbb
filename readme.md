Brunch With BBB
===============

A brunch skeleton based on Backbone Boilerplate Builder methods (and a little sugar)

Check out [grunt-bbb](https://github.com/backbone-boilerplate/grunt-bbb) for more info

Some of the key things in this brunch are:

Backbone (with awesome modular design)
Backbone Template Manager
Twitter Bootstrap
HTML5 Boilerplate
LESS
Font Awesome

I am still trying to figure out how to use brunch, so for now things probably don't work quite right.
I'll add instructions when I get it all worked out.

The good news is, it will still work with grunt-bbb commands :-)
